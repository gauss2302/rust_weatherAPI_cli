- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions.
- Supports multiple units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
- Provides error handling for invalid inputs and network issues.

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version)
- An API key from a supported weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)
